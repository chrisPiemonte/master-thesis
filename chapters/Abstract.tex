\chapter*{Abstract}
For this master's thesis, a pipeline of Machine Learning models has been implemented in order to detect and retrieve views of the same object in a set of images and use those as different point of view to make a more accurate classification. An high-level view of the pipeline consists in filtering irrelevant incoming images, detecting and cropping relevant region of interest (car parts in this case) and classifying them in predetermined classes. Deep learning techniques have emerged in recent years as powerful methods for learning feature representations directly from data, and have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the field of Computer vision. In particular generic object detection, which aims at locating multiple objects instances from a large number of predefined categories, it is emerging as one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in this field. 
In section one and two an overview of the basics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning for Computer vision is given together with a review of the strengths and weaknesses of state of the art detectors and approaches for image classification and object detection. A more in-depth explanation of the archiecture is discussed in section four and finally an evualuation of the approach is presented in the last section.
